### Description

This repo is to store a collection of code for computing optimal
regression design.

### Online computing tools such as Shiny App

- Finding Dual-Objective Optimal Designs for the Beta Regression Model
  <https://elviscuihan.shinyapps.io/Dc_optimal_design/>

- nonlinear models used in toxicology and for estimating the benchmark
  dose
  <https://willgertschapps.shinyapps.io/Single-Objective-Designs-for-Toxicology/>

- <https://pingyangchen.shinyapps.io/stdmmoptdesigninhibition/>. This
  seems outdated

- optimal designs for single substance and interaction trials in dose
  response experiments <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33232777/>

- Optimal Experimental Design for single substance and interaction
  trials <https://biostatistics.dkfz.de/DoseResponseDesigns/>

- <http://optimal-design.biostat.ucla.edu/optimal/> based on the paper
  <https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3781293/>. but it appeared
  to be out-of-service.

- Optimal Design Generation and Power Evaluation in R: The skpr Package
  <https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v099i01>

### Packages, Toolbox or code to code optimal regression design

- List of code complied by Prof.Â Radoslav Harman from Comenius
  University: <http://www.iam.fmph.uniba.sk/ospm/Harman/design/>

### TODO

- [ ] To add the titles and associated papers for each of the above
  link.
